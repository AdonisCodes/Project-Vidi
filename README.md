# 👁 Vision
"*The mind is what you have created.*" - David Goggins

My motivation for this project is to mainly improve my skills & build out a company that will grab peoples attention. This repo ( All the code is private in another repo ) is to test my skills over a prolonged period of time, to see if I am able to stick to something that interests me.

The project will be the sole project to make me bullet-proof to any layoffs ( I do freelancing mainly ), but if something terrible happens, I still have something to show for it.

# 💻 Tech

I will be using a vast array of technology, including the most up to date modern technology like 🦊 NextJS, 🐍 Python, 🐨Go & more. But also some lower level & "anchient" technology like © C, ☕ JAVA & 👨‍💻 Low level hardware programming if need be.

Here are a list of already confirmed languages:

- Python for main infra
- NextJS & SvelteKit for main guis
- Nextron for converting NextJS apps to desktop
- ReactNative for all the clients
- ...
